# Subarray and Substring

SubArray:

* No. 53:  Maximum Subarray: dynamic programming: keep the variable of maxEndingHere
* No. 152: Maximum Product Subarray
* No. 209: Minimum Size Subarray Sum \(all positive number\) 2 pointer
* No. 239: Sliding Window Maximum:
  * [Two Simple Pass, calculating maximum from two side](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/26480/o-n-solution-in-java-with-two-simple-pass-in-the-array)
  * Queue, only save the numbers that may be as a maximum, which always is the front of the queue
* No. 325: Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k: presix sum + hashmap [https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000005771068](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000005771068)
